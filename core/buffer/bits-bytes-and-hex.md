### Bits

A [**bit**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)
is the basic unit of information in computing
and digital communications usually expressed as 0 (Zero) or 1 (One).
The word bit is short for **b**inary dig**it**.
*Binary* means there are two options
e.g: true/false, 0/1 or on/off

#### Counting in Binary (bits)

Starting at Zero, the first 16 numbers in Binary are:

```
+---+---+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| 0 | 1 |  2 |  3 |   4 |   5 |   6 |   7 |    8 |    9 |   10 |   11 |   12 |   13 |   14 |   15 |
+---+---+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
| 0 | 1 | 10 | 11 | 100 | 101 | 110 | 111 | 1000 | 1001 | 1010 | 1011 | 1100 | 1101 | 1110 | 1111 |
+---+---+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

```
Did you spot the pattern(s)?

### Bytes

A [**byte**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte)
is a unit of digital information in computing and
telecommunications that most commonly consists of **eight bits**.

### *Hello!* in Binary (8-Bit ASCII)

```

### Hexadecimal

[Hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)

In mathematics and computing,
[hexadecimal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)
(also base 16, or hex)
is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16.
It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to
represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F
(or alternatively a–f) to represent values ten to fifteen.
