## Node.js (Core) API

The node.js ("core") has many useful modules.

We are going to cover the modules labeled **Stability**: **Stable**,
**API Frozen** and **Locked**. Only use the ***Experimental*** or ***Unstable***
core modules when you want to try the *latest & greatest* and at your own risk;
avoid using them on a project for a client
(unless you get agreement *in writing* that they want to sail close to the wind
  for a specific user feature).
